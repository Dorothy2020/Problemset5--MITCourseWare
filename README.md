NewsFeed

RSS Feed Filter
RSS Overview
News sites, such as Google News, have content that is updated on an unpredictable schedule.
One tedious way to keep track of this changing content is to load the website up in your browser
and periodically hit the refresh button.
Fortunately, this process can be streamlined and automated by connecting to the website's RSS
● ps5.py, a skeleton for you to fill in
● ps5_test.py, a test suite that will help you check your answers
● triggers.txt, a trigger configuration file
● feedparser.py, a module that will retrieve and parse feeds for you
● project_util.py, a module that converts simple HTML fragments to plain text
● mtTkinter.py, a module that handles graphic interface
feed, using an RSS feed reader instead of a web browser. An RSS reader (e.g. Sage) will
periodically collect and draw your attention to updated content.
RSS stands for "Really Simple Syndication." An RSS feed consists of (periodically changing)
data stored in an XML-format file residing on a web-server. For this problem set, the details are
unimportant. You don't need to know what XML is, nor do you need to know how to access
these files over the network. We have taken care of retrieving and parsing the XML file for you.
Data Structure Design
RSS Feed Structure: Google News
First, let's talk about one specific RSS feed: Google News. The URL for the Google News feed
is: http://news.google.com/?output=rss
If you try to load this URL in your browser, you'll probably see your browser's interpretation of
the XML code generated by the feed. You can view the XML source with your browser's "View
Page Source" function, though it probably will not make much sense to you. Abstractly,
whenever you connect to the Google News RSS feed, you receive a list of items. Each entry
in this list represents a single news item. In a Google News feed, every entry has the following
fields:
● guid  : A globally unique identifier for this news story.
● title  : The news story's headline.
● description  : A paragraph or so summarizing the news story.
● link  : A link to a website with the entire story.
● pubDate : Date the news was published
● category : News category, such as “Top Stories”
Generalizing the Problem
This is a little trickier than we'd like it to be, because each of these RSS feeds is structured a
little bit differently than the others. So, our goal is to come up with a unified, standard
representation that we'll use to store a news story.
We want to do this because we want an application that aggregates several RSS feeds from
various sources and can act on all of them in the exact same way. We should be able to read
news stories from various RSS feeds all in one place.

Problem 1
Parsing (see below for a definition) all of this information from the feeds that
Google/Yahoo/etc. gives us is no small feat. So, let's tackle an easy part of the problem first.
Pretend that someone has already done the specific parsing, and has left you with variables
that contain the following information for a news story:
2
● globally unique identifier (GUID) - a string
● title - a string
● description - a string
● link to more content - a string
● pubdate - a datetime
We want to store this information in an object that we can then pass around in the rest of our
program. Your task, in this problem, is to write a class, NewsStory, starting with a
constructor that takes (guid, title, description, link, pubdate ) as arguments
and stores them appropriately. NewsStory also needs to contain the following methods:
● get_guid(self)
● get_title(self)
● get_description(self)
● get_link(self)
● get_pubdate(self)
The solution to this problem should be relatively short and very straightforward (please review
what get methods should do if you find yourself writing multiple lines of code for each). Once
you have implemented NewsStory all the NewsStory test cases should work.

Parsing the Feed
Parsing is the process of turning a data stream into a structured format that is more convenient
to work with. We have provided you with code that will retrieve and parse the Google and Yahoo
news feeds.
Triggers
Given a set of news stories, your program will generate alerts for a subset of those stories.
Stories with alerts will be displayed to the user, and the other stories will be silently discarded.
We will represent alerting rules as triggers. A trigger is a rule that is evaluated over a single
news story and may fire to generate an alert. For example, a simple trigger could fire for every
news story whose title contained the phrase "Microsoft Office". Another trigger may be set up to
fire for all news stories where the description contained the phrase "Boston". Finally, a more
specific trigger could be set up to fire only when a news story contained both the phrases
"Microsoft Office" and "Boston" in the description.
In order to simplify our code, we will use object polymorphism. We will define a trigger interface
and then implement a number of different classes that implement that trigger interface in
different ways.
Trigger Interface
Each trigger class you define should implement the following interface, either directly or
transitively. It must implement the evaluate method that takes a news item (NewsStory object)
as an input and returns True if an alert should be generated for that item. We will not directly
3
use the implementation of the Trigger class, which is why it raises an exception should
anyone attempt to use it.
The class below implements the Trigger interface (you will not modify this). Any subclass that
inherits from it will have an evaluate method. By default, they will use the evaluate method in
Trigger, the superclass, unless they define their own evaluate function, which would then be
used instead. If some subclass neglects to define its own evaluate() method, calls to it will
go to Trigger.evaluate() , which fails (albeit cleanly) with the NotImplementedError :
